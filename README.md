# JavascriptTileEngine
tile engine in javascript using tiled map editor

The main purpose of this javascript file is to read in a tile map created through the Tiled software utilizing
multiple map layers, collisions, portals, and anything else I can think of into a web browser. This would allow me
to then create my own tile based 2d game or interactive web experience however I like. 

I plan to continue by learning Rails in order to gain the skills that will allow me to scale up by setting 
the stage for a potential online game/web applocation. I will also be ablea to leverage strong APIs in the future.
